## How to deploy

After cloning the project, locate **Monitor.sln** in the Monitor folder and open `VS2022`. Right-click the Monitor project in the solution, select Properties, and ensure that the configuration is set to `Release` `x64`. In the configuration properties, locate the **VC++ directory**, and under General, change the path of the include directory to your path.
